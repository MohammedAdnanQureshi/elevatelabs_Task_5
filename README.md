# elevatelabs_Task_5
Objective: Extract insights using visual and statistical exploration.


Dataset Used: train.csv from the Titanic Kaggle competition (includes passenger details and survival labels).

Data Inspection: Checked dataset shape, column types, and missing values using .info(), .describe(), and .isnull().sum().

Univariate Analysis: Explored distributions of key variables (Age, Fare, Sex, Pclass, Embarked) with histograms, boxplots, and countplots.

Bivariate Analysis: Compared Survived against features (e.g., gender, class, fare, age groups, family size) using bar plots and stacked histograms.

Correlation Study: Created heatmap and pairplots to examine relationships between numerical features and survival.

Feature Insights: Identified strong predictors like Sex, Pclass, Fare, and engineered new features (FamilySize, Title) for deeper insights.

Final Report: Added observations under each visualization and prepared a summary of findings, highlighting patterns, trends, and anomalies.
